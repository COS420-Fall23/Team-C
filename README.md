## Problem Statment
Statement 1:

Those who struggle with imposter syndrome often avoid asking questions or getting  feedback and criticism because they fear that this might confirm their insecurities. This prevents them from learning and growing. For example, In a coding class, a student who enters with no prior coding background is surrounded by peers who are already well-versed in coding. This situation can be quite overwhelming for our students, leading to self-doubt before they even begin their learning journey. Prior solutions have been to encourage professors and TAs to help  motivate and reassure the students that they are on the right path, as well as to build further connections with their students in hopes that they will feel more comfortable with reaching out. However, this solution doesn't consider how hard it may be for some students to ask for help and how being vulnerable to their peers can feel as if they are exposing themselves as a fraud within their field. How do we build an environment that promotes self-respect, self-encouragement, and a sense of confidence enough for the student to continue pursuing help where they are struggling and prepare professors to be able to prevent, identify, and resolve future occurrences? 

Statement 2:

Impostor syndrome is a pervasive issue that seriously undermines individuals' self-esteem and self-worth. This often involves constant self-comparisons, leading to overwhelming feelings of inadequacy and a profound sense of personal diminishment. Specifically, when students grapple with challenging academic subjects, they often find themselves overwhelmed by complex concepts, discouraging them and making them feel like outsiders among their peers. To address this pressing concern, past attempts to handle the situation have been to create a platform with expert mentors who can offer tailored guidance, answer questions, and provide support through various communication channels, such as chat or video calls; seems like a promising solution. However, it's important to note that the wrong approach by these experts can actually worsen self-doubt and further intensify imposter syndrome, highlighting the need for a thoughtful and nuanced approach. How can we implement strategies that offer users helpful information and mental health support resources while ensuring that experts actively contribute positively instead of making matters worse?
