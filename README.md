## Problem Statment
Statement 1:

Those who suffer from imposter syndrome may avoid asking questions or receiving comments and criticism out of concern that it would confirm their fears, which inhibits their ability to learn and grow. In a coding class, for example, a student with no prior coding experience is surrounded by peers already proficient in code. This circumstance can be intimidating for many students, leading to self-doubt before they begin their learning journey. Prior remedies included encouraging professors and teaching assistants to help motivate and reassure students that they are on the right track and to create deeper connections with their students in the hopes that they will feel more comfortable reaching out. What makes this strategy ineffective is that a student who feels insecure about their work is significantly less likely to build a connection with their professors. It also doesn't consider professors' difficulty in fully supporting students with different levels of expertise.  How do we create a climate that encourages vulnerability and builds a sense of confidence in students so that theyâ€™ll continue to seek help where they are struggling, while also preparing instructors to prevent, diagnose, and resolve future cases of impostor syndrome? 

Statement 2:

Imposter Syndrome can come in many different forms and can be influenced by many different aspects within a person's life, including their culture, environment, mental health and physical ability. The leading cause of imposter syndrome is heightened anxiety and a lack of confidence within themselves and their work. Most solutions in the past have simply ever focused on the effects of Imposter Syndrome, rather than focusing on remedying  the causes of it. For example, by simply getting teachers to help motivate the students and reassure them that they belong amongst their peers, this only focuses on trying to make the student feel better about themselves momentarily. This completely disregards the fact that it's the way the environment and support system is designed around them that makes them feel this way. Our hope with MentorMark is to build a platform that focuses on the systemic causes of Imposter Syndrome to build a world where students feel academically worthy amongst their peers.
